                <h2>Mechanical Keyboard</h2>
                <p>A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard built with high quality, typically spring activated, key switches. These key switches vary based on the keyboardâ€™s application or user preference.</p>
                <p>While some of the first widely sold keyboards such as IBM&#8217;s Model M in the 1980&#8217;s utilized mechanical switches, the 1990&#8217;s brought on a wave of inexpensive rubber dome keyboards that flooded the keyboard market. Rubber dome keyboards represent over 90% of keyboards in use today and provide an inexpensive but dissatisfying feel and typing experience.</p>
                <p>Mechanical keyboards raise the bar in every way. A mechanical keyboard&#8217;s switches, framing, functionality, type print methods, key construction, PCB board, LED lighting (sharpness, brightness, adjustability), and a slew of other features are far superior compared to traditional rubber dome keyboards. Most of these improvements boil down to one thing - feel. Mechanical keyboards simply feel better than rubber dome keyboards.</p>
